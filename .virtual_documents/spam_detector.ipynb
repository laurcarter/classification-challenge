# Create the labels set `y` and features DataFrame `X`



# Check the balance of the labels variable (`y`) by using the `value_counts` function.



# Split the data into X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test









from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Create the StandardScaler instance



# Fit the Standard Scaler with the training data



# Scale the training data






# Train a Logistic Regression model and print the model score
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression



# Make and save testing predictions with the saved logistic regression model using the test data

# Review the predictions



# Calculate the accuracy score by evaluating `y_test` vs. `testing_predictions`.






# Train a Random Forest Classifier model and print the model score
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier



# Make and save testing predictions with the saved logistic regression model using the test data


# Review the predictions



# Calculate the accuracy score by evaluating `y_test` vs. `testing_predictions`.
